function Eout=SCFR(Ein, lambda, d1,d2, f, degree, widex, widey)
% to achieve single cylindrical lens Fresnel diffraction with different rotation degree
% S- single  C-cylindrical lens  F- Fresnel diffraction  R-rotation 2-simplified version

% Ein is the input image or pattern, gray image,   'double type'
% lambda is the wavelength of the illumination source
% d1 is the distance of the first Fresnel diffraction between the input plane and the front plane of cylindrical lens
% d2 is the distance of the second Fresnel diffraction between the back plane of the cylindrical lens and CCD plane
% f is the focal length of the cylindrical lens
% degree is the rotation degree, degree system [0 360]
% widex and widey is the physical size of the input image, this version is availiable for that widex is equal to widey
